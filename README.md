## Project title :
GenesisCircuit: Automated PCB Design Generation


## Project description: 
GenesisCircuit is a multimodal AI-powered tool designed to revolutionize PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design by generating complete, production-ready PCB diagrams from text and diagram inputs. By autonomously creating optimized schematics, component placements, and routing, GenesisCircuit significantly reduces design cycles, minimizes errors, and streamlines the development process for engineers and designers.
